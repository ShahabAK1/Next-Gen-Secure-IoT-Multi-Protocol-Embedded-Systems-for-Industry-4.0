# Next-Gen Secure IoT: Multi-Protocol Embedded Systems for Industry 4.0

## Overview
This project demonstrates the development of a **secure and multi-protocol embedded system** designed for **Industry 4.0** applications. By utilizing the **STM32** and **ESP32** platforms, this system seamlessly integrates **UART**, **I2C**, and **One-Wire** communication protocols to manage real-time data from various sensors. The system ensures efficient, secure data transmission for industrial automation, providing a cutting-edge solution to the modern IoT challenges.

## Key Features
- **Multi-Protocol Communication**: Integrating **UART**, **I2C**, and **One-Wire** protocols for seamless data exchange.
- **Real-Time Sensor Integration**: Uses **DS18B20** (temperature), **MPU6050** (motion), and **PIR** (motion detection) sensors to gather real-time data.
- **Secure Wireless Communication**: Leverages **ESP32** for secure, encrypted data transmission.
- **Industry 4.0 Compatibility**: Enables automation, smart monitoring, and secure data transfer in industrial settings.
- **LED Indication**: Visual feedback with LEDs for system status (success/failure).
- **Cloud-Ready**: Data is transmitted to cloud systems for further analysis or monitoring.
- **Modular Design**: Easily extendable for additional sensors and communication protocols.

## Components Used
- **STM32F401RE** (Microcontroller)
- **ESP32-WROOM-32** (WiFi Communication)
- **DS18B20** (Temperature Sensor)
- **MPU6050** (Accelerometer and Gyroscope)
- **PIR Motion Sensor**
- **OLED 128x64 Display**
- **LED Indicators** (For Status, Error, Success)
- **Jumper Wires and Breadboard** (For prototyping connections)

## Communication Protocols
This project utilizes three key communication protocols to handle data exchange:
1. **UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter)**: Used for serial communication between STM32 and ESP32.
2. **I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit)**: For communication with sensors like the **MPU6050** and the **OLED display**.
3. **One-Wire**: Used for the **DS18B20** temperature sensor for real-time data retrieval.

These protocols ensure reliable, high-speed communication and offer flexibility for future system extensions.

## Security Features
Security is a priority for IoT applications, and this system is equipped with:
- **Data Encryption**: Ensures secure transmission of sensor data over WiFi using **ESP32**.
- **Authentication Mechanisms**: Ensures data integrity and only authorized devices can send/receive data.
- **Secure Channel Communication**: Utilizing secure channels to prevent unauthorized access and tampering.

## System Architecture
The system architecture involves multiple layers of communication between sensors, microcontrollers, and the cloud:
1. **Sensors** (DS18B20, MPU6050, PIR) capture data.
2. **STM32F401RE** processes sensor data and communicates via UART and I2C with the ESP32.
3. **ESP32-WROOM-32** securely transmits data wirelessly to a remote server or cloud application for monitoring and analysis.

## Applications
- **Smart Factories**: Automating data collection from various sensors for real-time monitoring and control.
- **Industrial Automation**: Enabling secure, wireless communication in industrial settings.
- **Remote Monitoring**: Collect and analyze environmental data in remote locations.
- **IoT Security**: Ensuring secure transmission of sensor data in an IoT ecosystem.
